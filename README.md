Hashing in C involves using a hash function to convert data (such as a string) into a fixed-size numerical value, which is typically used to index an array. The main purpose of hashing is to enable fast data retrieval. Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of the concept:

Key Concepts
Hash Function:

A hash function takes input (keys) and returns a fixed-size string or number (hash value).
The goal is to distribute hash values uniformly across a table to minimize collisions.
Common hash functions include division-remainder, multiplication, and cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256).
Hash Table:

A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.
Each slot in the array can store data associated with the key.
Ideally, the hash table allows for constant time complexity (O(1)) for search, insert, and delete operations.
